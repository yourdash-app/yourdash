**Core**

- **Code Editor Engine**: This would be the core of the application where the actual editing of code takes place. It
  should support the basic functionalities such as text insertion, deletion, caret movement etc.

- **Buffer Management**: This component handles the opening, closing, and switching between different files/tabs.

- **Undo/Redo Stack**: This component would manage all the changes being made to the code allowing the user to undo or
  redo actions.

- **Text Operation**: This component could handle operations such as multi-selection, multiple cursors, and code
  folding.

**Features**

- **Code Completion Engine**: This would be a separate component trained on a significant amount of code to provide
  context-aware suggestions.

- **Linting Engine**: This would be another independent component responsible for static code analysis and providing
  feedback on possible improvements and errors.

- **Snippet Manager**: This module would manage code snippets that users use frequently, allowing quick insertion.

- **Search & Indexing Engine**: This component would be responsible for maintaining an index of files and text for quick
  searching & navigation.

- **Syntax Highlighting Engine**: This would be a separate component responsible for highlighting code syntax for
  different languages.

**UI**

- **Editor UI Component**: This is the interface through which users interact with the editor. It should be designed to
  be intuitive and customizable, with support for different themes and layouts.

- **Tabs UI Component**: This component would manage the tabs in the UI, updating the current tab, and switching between
  tabs.

- **Panel Component**: This component would manage the different panels (like console, debug, file structure, etc)
  around the editor, allowing resizing, reordering, and hiding.

**Parking lot**

- Spell check
- Git operations
- FTP operations
- Terminal integration
- Debugger
- **Integration APIs**: This can be used to extend the functionality of the editor, for example integration with version
  control systems, debuggers etc.
